âœ“ The learner will lodge a complaint to the training provider (application following)  
âœ“ The training provider will discuss the matter with the assessor and learner, and decide if the learner needs to be re-assessed  
âœ“ The learner may be re-assessed by a different assessor if he so chooses and the company finds just cause  
âœ“ If, after a second assessment, the learner is still disqualified, he/she may fill in the appeal form (this problem is explained to the learner every prior to assessment commencing, the form is attached)  
âœ“ The completed appeal form will be submitted to the manager  
âœ“ The manager will make a copy of the completed appeal form and submit the original to the SETA  
âœ“ The SETA will appoint a mediator to pass judgment on the appeal  
âœ“ The decision will be communicated to the manager and the learner after the mediation  
âœ“ This decision of the SETA mediator is final

**The learner has the right to seek clarity on any items discussed.**

**The learner has the right to have a copy of the assessment contract,** which must be signed and kept in the POE.

Each assessment application, outcome, results and reviews will be treated as a **confidential matter** by the candidate, assessor and moderators. No references will be made to any organization outside the SETA about the status of an application during the assessment process.

**The learner has three chances to master the unit standards.** If the learner is still not yet competent on any unit standard, then the assessor has the right to deem the learner not suitable for qualification.
